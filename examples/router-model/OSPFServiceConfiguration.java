 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class OSPFServiceConfiguration as well as methods comparable

 * OSPFServiceConfiguration is described as follows:
 * 
 * OSPFServiceConfiguration connects an OSPF service to its area configurations. The configurations are defined for the OSPF Service, and so do not
 * make sense as stand alone objects. This is the reason for the Min (1), Max (1) cardinalities on OSPFService. They mandate the instantiation of the
 * service and of this association for the referenced instance of OSPFAreaConfiguration. The area configuration acts as a focal point to bring
 * together the router (indicated as a ComputerSystem with an instance of OSPFService, associated to the AreaConfiguration using this relationship),
 * the area (indicated as an OSPFArea, associated to the AreaConfiguration using AreaOfConfiguration) and the address ranges for advertising
 * (indicated as instances of RangeOfIPAddresses, associated to the AreaConfiguration using RangesOfConfiguration). There would be an instance of
 * OSPFAreaConfiguration for each connected area of a router/OSPFService.
