 * A FilterList aggregates instances of (subclasses of) FilterEntryBase via the aggregation EntriesInFilterList. The filter entries are always ANDed
 * together when grouped by the FilterList. Note that it is possible to aggregate different types of filters into a single FilterList - for example,
 * packet header filters (represented by the IpHeadersFilter class) and IPsec security filters. A FilterList is weak to the network device (e.g., the
