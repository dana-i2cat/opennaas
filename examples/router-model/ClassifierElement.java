/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class ClassifierElement as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the ClassifierElementBean Interface. The CIM class ClassifierElement is described as
 * follows:
 * 
 * ClassifierElement represents the linkage, within a single ClassifierService, between a FilterList (that defines the criteria to select packets from
 * the stream of packets coming into the Service) and the next ConditioningService (to which the selected packets go after they leave the
 * ClassifierService). ClassifierElement has no properties of its own. It is present to serve as an aggregated entity into ClassifierService (using
 * the ClassifierElementIn ClassifierService association), and for associations with its FilterList (ClassifierElementUsesFilterList) and its next
 * ConditioningService (NextServiceAfterClassifierElement). Note that a ClassifierElement may be associated with a ClassifierService through the
 * NextServiceAfterClassifier Element association. This will occur when implementing hierarchical classification. In this case, the ClassifierElement
 * MUST NOT instantiate the ClassifierElement UsesFilterList association. Further, when a ClassifierElement is associated with a ClassifierService as
 * described above, the order of processing of the associated ClassifierService is a function of the ClassifierOrder property of the
 * ClassifierElementInClassifierService aggregation.
