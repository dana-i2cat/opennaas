/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined

 * SchedulingServiceToSchedule is described as follows: 
 * 
 * This is a top-level association, representing the relationship between a 
 * scheduler (PacketSchedulingService) and a SchedulingElement, in a 
 * configuration involving cascaded schedulers. The SchedulingElement, in 
 * turn, represents the information in a packet scheduling service that is 
 * specific to this scheduler, such as relative priority or allocated 
 * bandwidth. Although it cannot be expressed formally with the association 
 * cardinalities, there is an additional constraint on participation in this 
 * association. A particular instance of (a subclass of) SchedulingElement 
 * always participates either in exactly one instance of this association, or 
 * in exactly one instance of the association QueueToSchedule.
