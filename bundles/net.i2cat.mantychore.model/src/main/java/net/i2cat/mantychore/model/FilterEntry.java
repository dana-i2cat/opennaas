 * A FilterEntry is used by network devices to identify traffic and either 
 * forward it (with possibly further processing) to its destination, or to 
 * deny its forwarding. It is one of the building block of FilterLists. This 
 * class is oriented towards packet filtering. Other subclasses of 
 * FilterEntryBase can be defined to do other types of filtering. A
