/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class ForwardingService as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * ForwardingServiceBean Interface. The CIM class ForwardingService is 
 * described as follows: 
 * 
 * This class represents the functions used in forwarding network traffic. Its 
 * instances act on packets received from one or more ProtocolEndpoints or 
 * Services, and drop (discard), or send those packets to one or more other 
 * ProtocolEndpoints or Services. The explicit Endpoints being forwarded 
 * between, are described using the ForwardsAmong association (or one of its 
 * subclasses). Generally, the Endpoints are at the same protocol layer and 
 * are usually of similar types, or of the same type. ForwardingService is 
 * different than RouteCalculation Service in that it represents the function 
 * of forwarding traffic independent of calculating routing information. 
 * Examining the ForwardingService class definition, note that its superclass 
 * NetworkService is deprecated. Therefore, NetworkService's properties need 
 * not be implemented in an instance of ForwardingService. Unfortunately, 
 * NetworkService cannot be removed from the object hierarchy without a major 
 * Schema release. When/if this occurs, the NetworkService superclass will be 
 * removed, and ForwardingService will subclass from CIM_Service directly. 
 * Also note that there are a large number of additional protocols that are 
 * not currently modeled. These will be added over time.
