 * SystemSpecificCollection represents the general concept of a collection that is scoped (or contained) by a System. It represents a Collection that
 * has meaning only in the context of a System, a Collection whose elements are restricted by the definition of the System, or both of these types of
 * Collections. This meaning is explicitly described by the (required) association, HostedCollection. An example of a SystemSpecificCollection is a
 * Fibre Channel zone that collects network ports, port groupings, and aliases (as required by a customer) in the context of an AdminDomain. The
 * Collection is not a part of the domain, but merely an arbitrary grouping of the devices and other Collections in the domain. In other words, the
 * context of the Collection is restricted to the domain, and its members are also limited by the domain.
