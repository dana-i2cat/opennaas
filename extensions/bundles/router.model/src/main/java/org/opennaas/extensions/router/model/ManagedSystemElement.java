	/**
	 * This method sets the ManagedSystemElement.operatingStatus property value. This property is described as follows:
	 * 
	 * OperatingStatus provides a current status value for the operational condition of the element and can be used for providing more detail with
	 * respect to the value of EnabledState. It can also provide the transitional states when an element is transitioning from one state to another,
	 * such as when an element is transitioning between EnabledState and RequestedState, as well as other transitional conditions. OperatingStatus
	 * consists of one of the following values: Unknown, Not Available, In Service, Starting, Stopping, Stopped, Aborted, Dormant, Completed,
	 * Migrating, Emmigrating, Immigrating, Snapshotting. Shutting Down, In Test A Null return indicates the implementation (provider) does not
	 * implement this property. "Unknown" indicates the implementation is in general capable of returning this property, but is unable to do so at
	 * this time. "None" indicates that the implementation (provider) is capable of returning a value for this property, but not ever for this
	 * particular piece of hardware/software or the property is intentionally not used because it adds no meaningful information (as in the case of a
	 * property that is intended to add additional info to another property). "Servicing" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned,
	 * or otherwise administered. "Starting" describes an element being initialized. "Stopping" describes an element being brought to an orderly stop.
	 * "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the
	 * state and configuration of the element might need to be updated. "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced. "Completed"
	 * indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded in the PrimaryStatus
	 * so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the
	 * operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error). "Migrating" element is being moved between host elements.
	 * "Immigrating" element is being moved to new host element. "Emigrating" element is being moved away from host element. "Shutting Down" describes
	 * an element being brought to an abrupt stop. "In Test" element is performing test functions. "Transitioning" describes an element that is
	 * between states, that is, it is not fully available in either its previous state or its next state. This value should be used if other values
	 * indicating a transition to a specific state are not applicable. "In Service" describes an element that is in service and operational.
