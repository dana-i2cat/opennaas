 * The ScopedSettingData class represents the general concept of SettingData, which is scoped or contained by a ManagedElement (that is, settings that
 * are specifically defined for a system, device, and so on). ScopedSettingData is tied to a ManagedElement using the ScopedSetting association. Note
 * that the cardinality of the ManagedElement reference is Min(1), Max(1). This cardinality mandates the instantiation of the ScopedSetting
 * association for the referenced instance of ScopedSettingData. ScopedSetting describes the existence requirements and context for the referenced
 * instance of ManagedElement. Specifically, the ManagedElement must exist and it provides the context for the ScopedSettingData.
