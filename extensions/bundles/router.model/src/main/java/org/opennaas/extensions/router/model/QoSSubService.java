 * The associations - QoSSubService and QoSConditioningSub Service - operate in conjunction. High level QoS definitions, such as 'John gets Gold
 * Service', map to lower level, more concrete QoSServices (the subclasses of QoSService). This is described by the QoSSubService association. In
 * turn, each of the SubServices may require their own conditioning. This is modeled using the QoSConditioningSubService aggregation. Note that a more
 * concrete QoSService may only be aggregated into one higher level Service, using this association. The cardinality on the GroupComponent reference
