 * The BGP speakers in an AS are required to be fully meshed. This can lead to a huge number of TCP connections per router. One way to reduce the
 * peering requirements is to use a route reflector. This is based on specifying one or more routers to act as focal points for IBGP sessions. The
 * route reflector as a whole is called a cluster. It is logically divided into three types of routers: reflectors, clients of the route reflector(s),
 * and non-clients of the route reflector. There can be more than one route reflector in a cluster, and there can be more than one cluster in an AS.
