 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class ServiceAvailableToElement as well as methods

 * ServiceAvailableToElement is described as follows:
 * 
 * CIM_ServiceAvailableToElement conveys the semantics of a Service that is available for the use of a ManagedElement. An example of an available
 * Service is that a Processor and an enclosure (a PhysicalElement) can use AlertOnLAN Services to signal an incomplete or erroneous boot. In reality,
 * AlertOnLAN is simply a HostedService on a computer system that is generally available for use and is not a dependency of the processor or
 * enclosure. To describe that the use of this service might be restricted or have limited availability or applicability, the
 * CIM_ServiceAvailableToElement association would be instantiated between the Service and specific CIM_Processors and CIM_Chassis.
