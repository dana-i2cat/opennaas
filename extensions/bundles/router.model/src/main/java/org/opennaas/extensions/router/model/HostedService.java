 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class HostedService as well as methods comparable to the

 * 
 * CIM_HostedService is an association between a Service and the System on which the functionality is located. The cardinality of this association is
 * one-to-many. A System can host many Services. Services are weak with respect to their hosting System. Heuristic: A Service is hosted on the System
 * where the LogicalDevices or SoftwareFeatures that implement the Service are located. The model does not represent Services hosted across multiple
 * systems. The model is as an ApplicationSystem that acts as an aggregation point for Services that are each located on a single host.
