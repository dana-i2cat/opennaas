 * This association represents the binding, in the ingress direction, between a ProtocolEndpoint and the first ConditioningService that processes
 * packets received via that Endpoint. Since there can only be one 'first' ConditioningService for a ProtocolEndpoint, the cardinality for the
 * Dependent object reference is narrowed from 0..n to 0..1. On the other hand, a single ConditioningService can be the first to process packets
 * received via multiple ProtocolEndpoints. So, the cardinality of the Antecedent object reference remains 0..n.
