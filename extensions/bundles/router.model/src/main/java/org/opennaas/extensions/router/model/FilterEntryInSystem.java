 * 
 * All filter entries (FilterEntryBase and its subclasses) are defined in the context of a ComputerSystem/network device, where they are used to
 * identify and act on network traffic. Note that this class is deprecated since its subclassing is not correct. It subclasses from System Component,
 * but a FilterEntryBase is NOT a Component of a System. Instead, it is hosted/scoped by the System. In versions up to CIM 2.6, FilterEntryInSystem
 * was a mandatory, Weak relationship. This is no longer true, beginning with CIM V2.7.
