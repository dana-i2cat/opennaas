/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class CollectionOfMSEs as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the CollectionOfMSEsBean Interface. The CIM class CollectionOfMSEs is described as
 * follows:
 * 
 * The CollectionOfMSEs object allows the grouping of Managed SystemElements for various identification purposes and to reduce the complexity of
 * associating Settings and Configurations. It is abstract to require further definition and semantic refinement in subclasses. The CollectionOfMSEs
 * object does not carry any state or status information, but represents only a grouping or 'bag' of Elements. For this reason, it is incorrect to
 * subclass groups that have state or status from CollectionOfMSEs. An example is CIM_Redundancy Group (which is subclassed from LogicalElement).
 * Collections typically aggregate similar ('like') objects,but they are not required to do so. Collections simply identify 'bags' and might represent
 * an optimization. This purpose is especially true with respect to their association to Settings and Configurations. Without Collections, you would
 * need to define individual ElementSetting and ElementConfiguration associations, to tie Settings and Configuration objects to individual
 * ManagedSystemElements. There might be duplication when assigning the same Setting to multiple objects. In addition, using the Collection object
 * allows the determination that the Setting and Configuration associations are indeed the same for the Collection's members. This information would
 * otherwise be obtained by defining the Collection in a proprietary manner, and then querying the ElementSetting and ElementConfiguration
 * associations to determine if the Collection set is completely covered.
