 * Note: The use of the CIM_ProvidesServiceToElement class has been deprecated. Instead, ServiceAvailableToElement conveys the semantics of use, while
 * the subclasses of ProvidesServiceToElement (or the ConcreteDependency association) describe dependency relationships. CIM_ProvidesServiceToElement
 * was meant to generalize the ServiceServiceDependency association. This method indicates that ManagedElements can use the functionality provided by
 * one or more Services. An example of the association is that a Processor and an enclosure (a PhysicalElement) can use AlertOnLAN Services to signal
 * an incomplete or erroneous boot. In reality, AlertOnLAN is simply a HostedService on a computer system that is generally available for use and is
 * not a dependency of the processor or enclosure. To describe that the use of the service might be restricted or have limited availability or
 * applicability, the CIM_ServiceAvailableToElement association would be instantiated.
