/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class IPRoute as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the IPRouteBean Interface. The CIM class IPRoute is described as follows:
 * 
 * An IPRoute relates a destination address to the address or interface through which the remote address may be reached. The destination address may
 * be a specific IP endpoint or a subnet, dependent on the mask. An instance of this class represents either static or dynamic routing. Static routes
 * are distinguished by setting the IsStatic boolean property to TRUE. Since many routes between endpoints can be defined (using different route
 * calculation algorithms), the CIM_IPRoute class is defined as Abstract. This forces subclassing (for example, see CIM_BGPIPRoute) and allows the
 * instances of its subclasses to be distinguished based on their CreationClassName key property. IPRoute is deprecated in lieu of the more general,
 * concrete NextHopIPRoute class. NextHopIPRoute allows the definition of BOTH a next hop address and an interface for transmission of the traffic.
 * Also, it does not mandate the instantiation of a ForwardingService class.
