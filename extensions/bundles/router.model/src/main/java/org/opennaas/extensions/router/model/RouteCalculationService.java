 * This is an abstract base class, derived from Service, that represents the route calculation aspects of a system. This class also addresses
 * functions performed by the system when it exchanges routing information. Examining the RouteCalculationService class definition, note that its
 * superclass NetworkService is deprecated. Therefore, NetworkService's properties need not be implemented in an instance of RouteCalculationService.
 * Unfortunately, NetworkService cannot be removed from the object hierarchy without a major Schema release. When/if this occurs, the NetworkService
 * superclass will be removed, and RouteCalculationService will subclass from CIM_Service directly. Also note that there are a large number of
 * additional routing protocols that are not currently modeled. These will be added over time.
