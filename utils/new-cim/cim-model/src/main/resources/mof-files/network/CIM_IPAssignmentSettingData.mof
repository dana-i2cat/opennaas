    Description ( 
       "This SettingData instance is the aggregation point identifying "
       "an IP configuration. Multiple IP configurations could exist "
       "for a target. Each configuration is represented with an "
       "instance of IPAssignmentSettingData. The details of the IP "
       "configuration are defined by instances of sub-classes of this "
       "class (i.e. StaticIPAssignmentSettingData, DHCPSettingData, "
       "DNSSettingData). These instances are associated with the "
       "IPAssignmentSettingData instance using the OrderedComponent or "
       "ConcreteComponent associations. For example, a static IP "
       "configuration would be represented by an instance of "
       "IPAssignmentSettingData and an instance of "
       "StaticIPAssignmentSettingData associated via an instance of "
       "ConcreteComponent. A static IP configuration including DNS "
       "would be modeled using an instance of IPAssignmentSettingData, "
       "DNSSettingData, and StaticIPAssignmentSettingData. The "
       "DNSSettingData and StaticIPAssignmentSettingData instance "
       "would be associated with the IPAssignmentSettingData using "
       "instances of ConcreteComponent." )]
