 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class RoutingProtocolDomain as well as methods comparable to

 * described as follows:
 * 
 * A Routing Protocol Domain is a collection of routers which coordinate their routing knowledge using a single [instance of a] routing protocol. This
 * class represents the area/layer/level/zone like property of a routing protocol, such as an OSPF (area), IS-IS (layer) or PNNI (level). It does not
 * represent the entire routing domain in every case. For example for OSPF, it represents an Area, but in the case of RIP, it represents the whole RIP
 * domain. Any common attributes of these routing domains can be placed in this class in future versions of CIM.
