/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class QoSService as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the QoSServiceBean Interface. The CIM class QoSService is described as follows:
 * 
 * This is a concrete class that represents the ability to conceptualize a QoS service as a set of coordinated sub-services. This enables the network
 * administrator to map business rules to the network, and the network designer to engineer the network such that it can provide different functions
 * for different traffic streams. This class has two main purposes. First, it serves as a common base class for defining various sub-services that are
 * needed to build higher-level QoS services. Second, it serves as a way to consolidate relationships between different types of QoS services and
 * different types of ConditioningServices. For example, Gold Service may be defined as a QoSService which aggregates two other QoSServices together.
 * Each of these 'other' QoSServices could be DiffServServices - one representing the servicing of very high demand packets (instantiated as a
 * DiffServService directly), and one representing the service given to most of the packets (instantiated as an AFService). The high demand
 * DiffServService instance would use QoSConditioning SubService to aggregate together the necessary classifiers to indicate which traffic it applies
 * to, the appropriate meters for contract limits, the marker to mark the EF PHB in the packets, and the queuing-related services. The AFService
 * instance would similarly use QoSConditioning SubService to aggregate its classifiers, meters, the several markers used to mark the different AF
 * PHBs in the packets, and the queuing-related services needed to deliver the packet treatment.
