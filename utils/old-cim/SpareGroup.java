 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class SpareGroup as well as methods comparable to the

 * 
 * A class derived from RedundancyGroup indicating that one or more of the aggregated elements can be spared. (The actual Spares are defined using the
 * ActsAsSpare association.) An example is the use of redundant NICs in a ComputerSystem - where one NIC is primary and the other is Spare. The
 * 'primary' NIC would be a member of the SpareGroup (associated using the RedundancyComponent class) and the 'other' NIC would be associated using
 * the ActsAsSpare relationship. The use of the class is being deprecated in lieu of using the RedundancySet class.
