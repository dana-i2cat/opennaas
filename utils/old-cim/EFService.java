/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class EFService as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the EFServiceBean Interface. The CIM class EFService is described as follows:
 * 
 * This class represents a specialization of the general concept of forwarding network traffic by adding specific semantics that characterize the
 * operation of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Service (defined in RFC 2598). The EF PHB can be used to build a low loss, low latency, low jitter,
 * assured bandwidth, end-to-end service through DiffServ domains. Such a service appears to the endpoints like a point-to-point connection or a
 * virtual leased line. This service has also been described as Premium service in the IETF literature. RFC 2598 defines one DSCP for the EF service.
 * Thus, there is no need to define any attributes in this class, since an instance of the EFService class, by definition, means that this particular
 * DSCP is used. EFService is deprecated since forwarding based on the value of the DiffServ Code Point is specified using a FilterList, which is
 * associated with a ClassifierElement. If there is a need to distinguish a higher-level set of coordinated QoS services, the DiffServService class
 * can be instantiated directly.
