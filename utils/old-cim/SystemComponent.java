 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class SystemComponent as well as methods comparable to the

 * follows:
 * 
 * CIM_SystemComponent is a specialization of the CIM_Component association that establishes 'part of' relationships between a System and any
 * ManagedSystemElements of which it is composed. Use this association with caution when using it instead of a subclass such as SystemDevice or a peer
 * association such as HostedService. This class is very broadly defined, which can lead to erroneous use. For example, Access Points that are
 * dependent on (and hosted on) a System are NOT Components of the System. The System is not made up of any AccessPoint 'parts', which is why a
 * Dependency association, HostedAccessPoint, was defined. Similarly, a PhysicalPackage is not a 'part' of a System, because the physical element
 * exists independently of any internal components, software, and so on. In fact, again, a Dependency relationship is true where a ComputerSystem is
 * Dependent on its packaging, as described by the ComputerSystemPackage association.
