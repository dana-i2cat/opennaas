 * is described as follows:
 * 
 * TextRedirectionService provides the capability to redirect a text console output to the remote console. For example, any text stream directed to a
 * Serial COM Port (by the operating system) on a Computer System can be redirected out to a remote administrator's console. Similarly the text input
 * keystrokes from the remote administrator's console can be redirected into the same COM Port. Each redirection stream is accessible via a
 * TextRedirectionSAP. This service can support multiple redirection streams via multiple associated TextRedirectionSAPs.
