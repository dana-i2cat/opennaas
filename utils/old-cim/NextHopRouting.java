/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined in the CIM class NextHopRouting as well as methods comparable to the
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the NextHopRoutingBean Interface. The CIM class NextHopRouting is described as follows:
 * 
 * NextHopRouting relates a destination address to the address or interface through which the remote address may be reached. An instance of this class
 * can represent either static or dynamic routing, and may represent a routing table entry (but it is not required that all NextHopRoutes be in a
 * routing table). Static routes are distinguished by setting the IsStatic boolean property to TRUE. Subclasses of NextHopRouting provide specific
 * protocol and Key information. NextHopRoutes are dependent on at least one ForwardingService to execute them. This is conveyed by the
 * CIM_NextHopForwardedByService association. NextHopRouting is deprecated in lieu of the more general, concrete NextHopRoute class. NextHopRoute
 * allows the definition of BOTH a next hop address and an interface for transmission of the traffic. Also, it does not mandate the instantiation of a
 * ForwardingService class. The latter is not needed if the sole purpose of the instance is to specify a 'desired/configured' route. This is simply a
 * specification of the next hop.
